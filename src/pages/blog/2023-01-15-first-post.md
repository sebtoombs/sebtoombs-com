New year, new site. Or so the saying goes. Right? üòÜ

I'm not sure. Anyway, I've been meaning to update my site for a while now (the old one was last published/updated probably 2 or so years ago), and I've finally got around to it.

I decided to give [Astro](https://astro.build/) a spin, and I've been really impressed with it. It's a static site generator that uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) components to generate HTML. It's a really nice way to build a site, and I'm really enjoying it.

I've also _fiiiiiiinally_ got around to setting up a blog here. I've been meaning to do it for a while, but I've never really had the time to sit down and write anything. I'm hoping that by having a blog here, I'll be more inclined to write more often ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you're reading this, thank you for being one of the 6 people to read it. I hope you enjoy the site, and I hope you come back to read more in the future.

Cheers!

Seb
